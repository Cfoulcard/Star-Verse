## State of the App

**ðŸ› This app is currently a work in progressðŸ› ** A future release will be planned on the Google Play Store!

## Contributing

Because this is an open source project, anyone familiar with the technologies used to build Android Apps is allowed to help. There are a couple of features that are to be developed in the app, and here as well as within the app will be a list of contributors who helped build the finished product! 

To contribute, please view the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Cfoulcard/Star-Verse/blob/main/contributing.md). It is important to note that the API Key used to parse pictures and other information will not be provided by me, but you can follow this [NASA API Generator Link](https://api.nasa.gov/) and this [Astrobin API](https://welcome.astrobin.com/application-programming-interface) to generate your keys and plug them into code where necessary. **Please do not publicly display your API Key, store in a different object/class and do not list it in your pull request!** 

The API code will look like this:

```kotlin
val url = "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod/?api_key=$API_KEY"
```

Where API_KEY is the variable used to parse the API Key.
